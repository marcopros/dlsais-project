## Tools
The Matching Agent uses the following tools to provide its service:
<ol>
<li><b><em>find_professionals()</em></b>: Finds available professionals based on the profession, issue, and location.</li>

<li><b><em>find_other_city()</em></b>: Helps locate other cities where the requested profession is available if no professionals are found in the specified location.</li>

<li><b><em>find_nearest_cities()</em></b>: Identifies nearby cities to expand the search using OpenStreetMap API for professionals if needed.</li>
</ol>
<br>
<br>


## Workflow Overview
<ol>
<li><b>User Input Analysis</b>
The agent begins by extracting key information from the user's request. This includes:
<ul> 

<li><b>Profession</b>: The type of professional the user is looking for (e.g., electrician, plumber).

<li><b>Issue</b>: The specific problem or service required (e.g., "fix a broken pipe").

<li><b>Location</b>: The city or area where the user needs the service.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Initial Search for Professionals</b>
Using the extracted profession, issue, and location, the agent queries the <em> find_professionals()</em> tool to identify relevant professionals. If professionals are found, the agent proceeds to select the best matches based on skills and ratings (point 5)
</li>
<br>

<li><b>Handling No Matches Found</b>
If no professionals are found in the user's specified location:
<ul>
<li>
The agent use the <em>find_other_city()</em> tool to search for nearby cities where the requested profession is available.
</li>
<li>
The agent will also use the <em>find_nearest_cities()</em> tool to find the nearest city to the user's location.
</li>
</ul>
<br>
<li><b>Second Search in Nearby City</b>
After identifying the nearest city, the agent will repeat the search for professionals using the new city. If successful, the agent presents professionals from the nearby city.
</li>
<br>
<li><b>Selection of Professionals</b>
Once a list of professionals is returned, the agent will select up to 5 professionals, ensuring that at least 2 are available. Prioritize professionals based on:
<ul>
<li>Relevance to the specific issue.</li>
<li>Higher ratings to ensure quality service.</li>
</ul>
</li>
<br>

<li><b>Presentation of Results</b>
The agent presents the selected professionals to the user in a clear and concise manner.
</li>

</ol>
